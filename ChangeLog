	this chapter is already rather fat...

	* TOC: Unpdated.
	* part3.texi:  Fixed a few typos preventing `make dvi' from
	working.

1999-09-06  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvv@techie.com>

	* examples/*/*: Updated to match text of book and tested.

	* part3.texi (Shared Libraries with libtool): Finished this
	section -- this chapter is already *much* bigger than I
	anticipated.  Maybe we should split it into a couple or three
	chapters somehow?  Perhaps I can move some of the content into
	other chapters too/instead.

1999-09-01  Gary V. Vaughan  <gvv@techie.com>
